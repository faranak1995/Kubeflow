In this scenario, first of all we should have a vision of our main figure.
We want to have a docker and kubernetes based system including containers to run the code without needed to install all the softwares in different systems and the same version.

1. Jupyter Notebook to coding
2. MINIO, Harbor or other softwares for data and model storage
3. Kubeflow pipelines
4. KServe for model inference and digital recognizer

To implement the system, first of all we should install the docker from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/ 

Then, install docker. Furthermore, you can use cmd (windows + R) to check the version of docker:

docker version

After making an account in docker hub and login you can check the images:

docker images

Also, you can check the images in your current local area:

docker images ls

In addition, you can pull an image from docker hub:

docker pull ubuntu

Command above download an ubuntu from docker hub and you can use it. If you want to edit it you should type: (you can use sudo)

docker pull -it ubuntu

To exit you can type:

exit

In addition, you can use Linux commands like ru (run), rm (remove), mkdir (make a folder), touch (make a file), nano (open and edit a file), mv (rename) etc.
